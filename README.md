## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    
    The Arial font was chosen as it is clear and easy to read to aid with accessibility and keep the site simple. Helvetica was chosen as a back up for the same reasons
    The Gloria Hallelujah font was chosen for the blog introduction and the blog entries themselves as it resembles handwritten text and I felt it would lend a more personal touch to the blog. I wanted it to feel as though the user was reading my diary entries directly.
    
  - **Colour scheme**
  - 
![colour-scheme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00aa9746-14ed-425e-979c-1dee50ba4843)

        
    As the blog is about nature and wildlife I wanted the colour scheme to reflect the colours I have in my garden. I wanted strong, primary colours for impact as they would be against a white background, but didn't want a large palette as I 
    included lots of images of wildlife that I didn't want to detract from. 
    The palette was chosen using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
    
  - **Imagery**
    
    The majority of the images used in each blog post are my own images taken of my garden and I was really proud to be able to use them. I had a lot of fun creating posts and uploading images. Seeing the finished article on the screen gave 
    me enormous pleasure despite the fact that the load time for my site was compromised.
    Two of the images were royalty-free stock images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) Acknowledgements for the individual photographers are in the [credits](#credits) section.

## DEPLOYMENT
The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:
 - Install the gunicorn python package and create a file called 'Procfile' in the repo's root directory
 - In the Procfile write 'web: gunicorn lunar_lists.wsgi'
 - In settings.py add ".herokuapp.com" to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list
 - In settings.py add 'https://*.herokuapp.com' to CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS list, git add, commit and push to github

Navigate to the Heroku dashboard
 - Create a new Heroku app
 - Give it a name and select the region 'Europe'
Navigate to settings tab and scroll down to Config Vars
 - Click 'Reveal Config Vars'
 - Add the following keys:
         key = DATABASE_URL | value = (my secret database url)
         key = SECRET_KEY | value = (my secret key)
Navigate to Deploy tab
 - Connect to GitHub and select the repo 'lunar-lists'
 - Scroll down to 'Manual deploy' and select the 'main' branch
 - Click 'Deploy Branch'

## TESTING

  ### HTML validation

I have used the W3C Markup validator to validate all of my HTML code - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

A different approach was required for validating the HTML for this project as all of the pages are developed using DTL and most require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use the URL so I have had to follow the below approach for every page:
  - navigate to the deployed Heroku link
  - right click to find the 'view page source' link
  - copy and paste the HTML code from here into the validator via the direct input

[home page html validation](readme.docs/home-page-html.png)

All HTML was checked and had no errors or warnings to show as indicated above. 
The home page had an initial error where I had nested a <p> within a <span> but I corrected this and commited the code and the validation was clear.

   ### CSS validation

[CSS validation](readme.docs/css-validation.png)
[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate my CSS file. External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested.

   ### Javascript validation

  [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - the JavaScript validation did not throw up and issues. The fact that the use of let and const to define variables and template literals is only available with ES6 was highlighted.

   ### Python validation
[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the python files I created or edited myself.
Initial errors were thrown up involving line length of comments and spacing but these were corrected.

### Accessibility     

The site was tested via WAVE the web accessibility evaluation tool and showed some alerts for contrast between the text and the background colour.
The first was for the message warning a user they are not logged in, which had white text against a bright red. The colour of the background was muted and checked via [Contrast Finder](https://app.contrast-finder.org/?lang=en) which showed excellent contrast. 
There was also a contrast issue between the white text and the orange background in the navbar and footer but I felt this was not enough of an issue to change the appearance and style of the whole site.


<br>


### Issues/Bugs

 - The icons were coded to load using a URL updated with a variable and a template literal but were not loading initially despite showing up when the link was hardwired in and the link being checked externally. The icons were added into a folder rather than being accessed via the API website but the issue remained.
 This remained an issue for a couple of days and advice was sought from Mark Briscoe who solved the issue by changing the way in which the src attribute in the HTML element was altered. 

  - the link to the JS file was added incorrectly to begin with

  - When the favicon was added the weather icons did not display on the deployed site...the script for font awesome had been added in the wrong place.

  - no reset button/facility was added in error and this was only noticed very late in the development - code was added to correct this but I ran out of time to be able to make it work

  - the location name was displaying as typed in the search box so ususally with a lowercase first letter - a line was added to the function to correct this
